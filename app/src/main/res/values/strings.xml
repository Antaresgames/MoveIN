        "MoveIN\n\n"

        "In today’s world, where everything is shifting towards internet and smartphones, people like using different services which give the ease of access and can help them accomplish their daily life tasks in an easy and efficient manner. Google maps is very popular in the respect that it helps the users in many emergency situations and makes them get to their desired location easily and efficiently. But there are not a lot of applications which focus on indoor map viewing or navigation. People generally find it difficult to go to a certain room or an office in a particular building. Hence we are also proposing a service for smartphones that will enable the users to view maps of indoor facilities just like google maps is used for outdoor purposes.\n\n"
        "The main goal of the project would be to provide an application that will allow the user to search of a desired place on google maps and then if the user wants to view the building from the inside, he/she would have the option to do that. The user would have the option to search for a particular place in that building and if he/she specifies a starting point on the map, a path would be displayed on the map which will help the user for navigation. If the person who is using the application is standing near the facility and using that application, he would be navigated by using wifi routers in that building as gps signals are not very strong and they also don’t have that much accuracy when it comes to indoor facilities.\n\n"
        "The user of the application would have different options when he/she wants to use the application. There would be an option to just view a map like in google maps. If the person thinks that the map available for that building is not correct and he wants to recommend a change, he/she needs to log in or make an account if he is a registered user. The change in the map would be implemented after following a defined change process that will also include ratings from different users. All the recommendations from different users would be saved on cloud for evaluation.\n\n\n"

        "Uses: \n\n"
        "The application would help all of the users who want to search inside a particular building. In this way, it will also help many security agencies for security related issues. In emergency situations, people would be able to search inside a hospital to go to a particular room quickly without wasting any time. All in all, it would help the users just like google maps but in indoor places where google maps isn’t available. \n\n"

"Main Functionalities:\n\n\n"

 "View:\n\n"

"In the view screen of the application, the google map will be displayed. In the bottom of the screen four icons will be available. First the user will enter  his/her desired  location in the google maps search bar and after finding the desired location the application will zoom in to that location. If there is an indoor map available then the user will be able to view that indoor map. If there is no indoor map available then a pop up window will be generated which will ask the user if he/she wants to design an indoor map. If yes then the design view will be appeared if not then the application goes back to the previous activity.\n\n\n"

        "Design:\n\n"

"In the Design part of the application the user will be provided with few options that includes the room, corridor, hall, reception, floor, and library etc. There will be an option of custom design that will allow the user to design a map of his own choice. The user would just select the area and the location on which he/she wants to build a certain item among the provided one and just have to drag and drop it down. After finishing the design part the user would send the designed map to the server and now this map would be available in the view activity as well.\n\n\n"

 "Navigate:\n\n"

"In the Navigate activity of the application the user would select the map and the application would load the selected map onto the application screen. Then the application would have 2 options that will ask the user to specify the starting and ending point on the map. The starting point could be the user’s current location. After that the path from the starting point to the ending point will be generated and displayed on the map. For navigation purpose the wifi signal strength will be used inside the building.\n\n"
